# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- We can:
+ Use CloudFront with Load Balancer instead of expose the EC2 instance IP address to the public internet.
+ Use AWS System manager to access EC2 Instances (here is the web application server)
+ Disable external access to the EC2 instances

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- Use VPC Enpoint to securely connect VPCs to AWS services and VPC enpoint services via AWS PrivateLink => Communication between VPC and these services remains within the AWS Network => Enhance security

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- No, enforcing default encryption won't automatically encrypt existing files, you'll also need to encrypt all the existing files separately.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- Undoing the remediation steps would reintroduce all the original security vulnerabilities => it's necessary to modify the CloudFormation scripts to incorporate the necessary changes.

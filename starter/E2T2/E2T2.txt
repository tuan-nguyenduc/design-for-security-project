Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

 Config security groups to deny ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
 Config security groups to deny ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
 Protocol UDP/TCP port 23 associated with 'Telnet' is expose to the internet
 Protocol UDP/TCP port 21 is associated with 'FTP' is expose to the internet
 Protocol UDP/TCP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is expose to the internet
 S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
 securityhub-encrypted-volumes-98327f39 (EC2 volumes are not encrypted)

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Provide specific IP address range for security groups ingress on port 22
Enable VPC flow logging
Remove unrestricted access to port 3389
Remove access to all the mentioned ports expose to the internet
Encrypt s3 buckets
Encrypt EC2 volumes
